For the past couple years, I have been talking with Dr. Lewis about my gender identity. I also discussed it at length with *whatever-her-name-was* at CAMHS.

I have never, not once in my life, felt anything close to a positive emotion when thinking about the idea of being 
'a man' or 'masculine'. At the very best, I have felt a numb and inert helplessness, and at the worst I have felt as though it would be easier if I died.

When I was younger, I was not really aware of what society calls gender. It was not an intuitive concept to me, probably because I'm autistic or something, but I don't remember ever really being aware that people expected me to conform to this male mold. I do, however, clearly remember times where I (unknowingly) did things that did not fit this mold, and people judged me 
for reasons I did not understand.

When I was in year 2 or 3 - around that age, I don't remember - there was some sort of school disco that we went to. Each classroom had things you could buy and things to do. You stayed in the main hall as I went in to the year 6 classroom with the few pounds you had given me and I went to a brightly coloured stall with a woman behind it who 
was painting nails. I asked to get mine in a red glittery colour. A few minutes later I came out to the hall and excitedly showed you my pretty new nails. I remember you looked upset and told me that it wasn't normal for a boy to do that. I didn't understand.

I remember that in primary school I sometimes would think how the names of some of my female classmates were so much 
nicer than mine, and I wish I had one like theirs. As strange of a thing that is to do.

Remember how I absolutely hated P.E.? The one subject where students were seperated by gender? As you know, it only got worse as time went on and I became more aware of what I 'was' to people, and what I 'had' to be. In year 7, I wished that in P.E. and swimming lessons I could instead be grouped with the girls.

As puberty started and went on, I felt that numb feeling the as the very things I hated the concept of being slowly became hard-baked into my appearance.

It was when I was 14 that everything started to set in for me. I realised what it was that was making me feel so horrible, and I finally understood the gist of society's concept of gender. I knew that I could absolutely not go on living my whole life that way, and that something had to change.

I didn't know what a transgender person was until late 2020, but the moment I learned what it meant to be transgender, I knew that I was. Descriptions of how transgender people felt growing up matched perfectly with my experience.

I knew that I wanted to be a woman, and I still know it. My judgment has not wavered for a single moment since.

It was around this time, mid 2021,that I bought that cheap skirt from Amazon. It wasn't much, but upon wearing it I felt instantly relieved of so much weight that was bearing down on me, and I finally felt like myself. It was as if I had been holding my breath for 14 years, and finally was able to again.

This wonderful feeling is known as *gender euphoria*. It is the opposite of what is called *gender dysphoria* or *gender incongruence*. It really is like nothing else. It is a complete happiness. It's the feeling you get when you are finally able to exist. Just exist. For that is something that I have not been able to do for a the large majority of my life. Even when happy, there's this deep sense of primal *wrongness* in your chest, and it just doesn't go away. Unless you get to exist.

At the BRIT School, I didn't hear the name that was given to me at birth once. I didn't hear the word he once, nor him. Instead, I was she. It was a place where I could exist, to some extent. 

There are others like me in my class, at least six I can think of off the top of my head, and each of them would corroborate these experiences.


Over the course of my time with Doctor Lewis, she gained an understanding of my experience and diagnosed me with the aforementioned *gender dysphoria*. Along with that, I was referred to Tavistock & Portman Gender Identify Clinic. I've been on the Tavistock waiting list for nearly a year now.

Now, with the backstory over, we are here. Stick with me.

**The Tavistock waitlist is twenty years long.** People die on this list. People kill themselves because they simply cannot endure the wait.

I will not allow that to happen to me.

There are, of course, private gender clinics. Some popular ones include Gender are and the Northern Gender Network. These are, however, really expensive.

Let's go through what these clinics do.

First: note that all medical stuff here was written from memory. I've read about all this extensively online and from NHS Documents.

First, at an 'initial assessment', the doctor will determine whether or not you require their care. Then, there'll be a couple more appointments where they just gather more info on you. Eventually, if they feel you are trans enough by some mysterious metric, They may prescribe you Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).

This typically comes in the form of a duotherapy - two medications are prescribed.  This will be an Estrogen, usually *Estradiol Valerate* if taken orally, and an Anti-androgen, commonly *Cyproterone Acetate*.

The Estrogen, which occurs naturally as the female sex hormone, serves as a replacement to Testosterone. The Anti-androgen serves to supress the body's production of Testosterone or to make the body less sensitive to Testosterone. Cyproterone Acetate does a bit of both.

Along with these medications, you receive blood tests (Once per 3 months in the first year, 2-3 times a year afterwards) to keep track of your estrogen and testosterone levels. You also generally receive an initial test of liver function, as Cyproterone Acetate can, usually in high doses, rarely cause liver issues due to a side effect of increasing the number of liver enzymes present. This has only been reported to happen in very high dosages of the medicine (>100-300mg /day) when it is used as a prostate cancer treatment. The typical dosage for Hormone Replacement Therapy is 12.5mg /day, a level at which the risk profile is not to worry about.

Estradiol Valerate is prescribed at a rate of 2-3mg/day. Any health risks associated with taking it should not alarm you, because this very drug is naturally in your body at a higher level than this HRT dosage can provide to someone born male. Just to be comprehensive, though, risks include Venous Thromboembolism (Blood clotting), Breast Cancer, and Benign tumour growth.

Again, the risk of someone on HRT having any of these symptoms is lower than the risk *you* having these symptoms by virtue of existing in a female body.

The effects of HRT are slow, taking many years to complete, and most are entirely reversible. Effects include:

- Body fat redistribution - *android*/male body fat patterns change to *gynoid*/female body fat patterns. This means more fat on the arms, legs, face, etc and less on the stomach and surrounding the internal organs (*visceral fat*) 
--Time to complete: years.
--Reversible: yes.

- Breast growth, just like in female puberty. Because it literally is female puberty. 
--Time to complete: years.
--Reversible: via surgery.

- Softer and more sensitive skin
Time to complete: months.
--Reversible: yes.

- Stronger emotions, happier happies, sadder sads.

On a personal note, I credit testosterone for my complete lack of ability to express negative emotions unless I'm having a breakdown. Many people with male minds, including me, find it completely impossible to cry unless breaking down. Which is not fun.
--Time to complete: months
--Reversible: yes

- Period-like symptoms,
Of course I do not mean bleeding. I mean a monthly cycle of emotions and cramping, just like in someone born female.
--Time to complete: months.
--Reversible: yes.

- Infertility 
With a significantly lower testosterone level comes the halt of sperm production, and commonly erectile dysfunction. I don't care. Honestly, both pluses for me.
--Time to complete: months.
--Reversible: usually, rarely not.

- Libido changes
Blah blah, less male-like sexual experience more female-like sexual experience.
--Time to complete: months.
--Reversible: yes.


- Penile/testicular shrinkage
Only happens sometimes. Wouldn't mind though.
--Time to complete: months-years.
--Reversible: i cannot remember for I never cared.

- Less body hair
--Time to complete: years.
--Reversible: yes.

- Male pattern baldness stopped/slowed/partially reversed
--Time to complete: months-years.
--Reversible: yes.

- Skeletal changes - wider pelvis
--Time to complete: years-decades.
--Reversible: no.

- Voice changes: DO NOT OCCUR.

So, that's the rundown on what happens when you either wait 20 years or pay a private doctor a preposterously high amount of money.

Some parents feel as though their child 'dies' in some way. You know, like "oh my baby has gone on this medication and it has killed who they once were!". *I trust you to be more reasonable than this*. Whatever medicine I take does not change who I am or who I have been. I would still be your child. There is no reason to feel grief-stricken.
