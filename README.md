For the past couple years, I have been talking with Dr. Lewis about my gender identity. I also discussed it at 
length with *whatever-her-name-was* at CAMHS.

I have never, not once in my life, felt anything close to a positive emotion when thinking about the idea of being 
'a man' or 'masculine'. At the very best, I have felt a numb and inert helplessness and at the worst I have felt as 
though it would be easier if I died.

When I was younger, I was not really aware of what society calls gender. It's probably because I'm autistic, or 
something, but I don't remember ever really being aware that people expected me to conform to this male mold. I do, 
however, clearly remember times where I (unknowingly) did things that did not fit this mold, and people judged me 
for reasons I did not understand.

When I was in year 2 or 3 - around that age, I don't remember - there was some sort of school disco that we went to. 
Each classroom had things you could buy and things to do. You stayed in the main hall as I went in to the year 6 
classroom with the few pounds you had given me and I went to a brightly coloured stall with a woman behind it who 
was painting nails. I asked to get mine in a red glittery colour, and a few minutes later I came out to the hall and 
excitedly showed you my pretty new nails. I remember you looked disappointed and told me that it wasn't normal for a 
boy to do that. I didn't understand.

I remember that in primary school I sometimes would think how the names of some of my female classmates were so much 
nicer than mine, and I wish I had one like theirs. As strange of a thing that is.

Remember how I absolutely hated P.E.? The one subject where students were seperated by gender? As you know, it 
only got worse as time went on and I became more aware of what I 'was' to people, and what I had to be. In year 7, I 
wished in P.E. and swimming lessons that I could instead be grouped with the girls.

As puberty started and went on, I felt that numb feeling the as the very things I hated the concept of being slowly 
became hard-baked into my appearance.
